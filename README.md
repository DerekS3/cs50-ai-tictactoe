# CS50 AI Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of the CS50 Artificial Intelligence course.

## Features
- An AI opponent that uses optimal strategy to either win or force a draw.
- Implements Minimax algorithm for decision-making.

## Implementation

The functions in `tictactoe.py` were developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Each function was iteratively implemented by writing tests first, then developing the code to pass the tests.

### Test Suite
The test suite `test_tictactoe.py` was built using Python's `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of the Tic-Tac-Toe logic and ensure that the AI behaves as expected.
